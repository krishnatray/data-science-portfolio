They have a series for kids who don‚Äôt sleep how convenient is that!,5.0,4.29.1,Kids,67
"I subscribed and then unsubscribed. I want to use it for a month. The app and meditations are the best compared to any other app I have used, but the price is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. If it was $4 or $5 I would keep it ever. But it‚Äôs hard justify paying $11.99 (the same price of Netflix or Spotify) for an app I am only using 5-10 min a day. At least, with Netflix I am using it several hours a month.",1.0,4.29.1,"Great, but way too expensive",400
I have a hard time sleeping. I just think too much then I‚Äôm up worrying about stuff that happened a long time ago. I just don‚Äôt let go of anything and this app helped me and I do a session of it every night Bc I usually go to sleep at like 2:30 and I actually go to sleep and this really helps me get a rest because on my own I can‚Äôt then I get in trouble from my mom for being up all night then i go to sleep in school and the teachers call my mom and I get my phone tooken away or something,3.0,4.29.1,This app,492
"I like this app a lot. I think the premium membership is a bit pricey but I guess it depends on how much you use it. I think the amount of free lessons are fair, but the only downside to that is that some of the unguided therapy sessions still cost money, which I think is a joke. Other than that, great app that I recommend to anyone willing to try meditation.",5.0,4.29.1,I Like the app,361
Any plans to develops an app for apple watch?,5.0,4.29.1,Daily go to!,45
I am not calm I am stressed because there‚Äôs only two things that are free and I can not mediate,2.0,4.29.1,Don‚Äôt get the app,95
"This has been the biggest waste of time. I was told meditation would help me sleep, but all it did was keep me up listening to this person and following what they say just to keep laying there awake, hoping that I could sleep.",1.0,4.29.0,Meditation doesn‚Äôt help you sleep,226
I used to love this app but the update is terrible! Takes forever to load and hard to find my old content. Bummed out,3.0,4.29.0,Way worse after the update,117
"There‚Äôs a specific icon for premium content yet some things don‚Äôt have the icon and it still says you require a premium account, which is pretty annoying. 

The interface is intuitive and the content generally is pretty good. 

I also don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt select multiple options when searching for type of content. 

There‚Äôs no thunderstorm meditation which is also kind of silly. 

My last qualm is there isn‚Äôt the type of meditation for really dark or suicidal thoughts, which lets be real, in this world, people need that more than ever.",3.0,4.29.0,Free Version is Super Limited,546
"I enjoy listening to the mediations while commuting to work, I love the various topics they have and that my kids can enjoy this app too.  It's a breath of fresh air when you're feeling overwhelmed.",5.0,4.27.1,The Best Medicine for your Brain,198
"I have had this downloaded for quite a while before I actually started mediating. It really is a great app. I have ADD and a short attention span, so meditating for five minutes has made meditation much easier. 
1) I severely wish that there was a way to make your own playlists and a better way to organize your saved meditions
2) I wish the app was cheaper. I would pay $5 a month, but not much more than that. Nothing you get a subscription for is reasonably priced anymore. 

I really love how you can rate what you did not like about a meditation. It would be nice if you could pick multiple things or write your own review. I wish you could rate what you LIKED about a meditation. 

My biggest thing is a playlist. I don't remember which ones I liked, and I have to go through my saved lists to even find what I wanted to listen to.",3.0,4.28.1,"Great app, but could easily be improved",838
You have to pay for many lessons but they work,5.0,4.28.1,Good,46
"Simple Habit has literally changed my life. I am so grateful for it and recommend it to everyone! I use it at least once a day to start my day off right, often before bed, and throughout the day. Best mindfulness app on the market by far. The teachers are awesome and the always increasing content keeps me learning every day. I‚Äôm a happier, calmer, nicer person because of it. Thank you!!!!!",5.0,4.28.1,Life changing,392
I love it,5.0,4.28.1,Great,9
Great way to meditate without being overwhelmed.  I start the day with 5 minutes and I feel calmer in the mornings than usual.,5.0,4.28.1,Bite sized,126
I was going a very difficult time in my life and this app has been my saving grace. It's help put my life in a manageable meaningful perspective.,4.0,4.28.1,Much Needed!,145
"Plenty of free options offered through this app. You don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre pushed into the subscription. Which I love!   The subscription is pretty cheap though $11.99 a month is so affordable for this great of an  app. They have helped me sleep better, calmed my anxiety and so much more! My kids even love the stories and the sleep music for bed!  I plan to purchase the subscription soon because honestly this app is truest worth the money.  I hope they never change this app at all!!!",5.0,4.28.1,Love this App!!!,489

"I need lots of free guidelines& meditations to decide whether or not to pay for a subscription. Many people probably feel as I do. I am hoping that I will be able to decide. There are SO many meditation apps out there! Time will tell‚Ä¶ But again, so far so good!",5.0,4.28.1,So far so good....,261
Thank you for the important work you do. May more people tap into the miracles of meditation. üíú‚òÆÔ∏èüíú‚òÆÔ∏è,5.0,4.28.1,Centered,100
"One day I realized that I wanted to try something new and I came a cross this app. So far I have loved it but I do wish that there is more content without needing to pay. There still are several sleep sounds but not to many variations of meditation practices for those who are not members. I still think you should try this out, it‚Äôs a lot better than other meditation apps too.",4.0,4.28.1,Great for beginners but could be batter,378

"I was loving this app and listened to the same medications to help me sleep for several months until it wanted me to pay premium for the meditations I came to love and was used to. It seems as if I can never download an app without having to pay a monthly subscription. 
But, it has a lot of great meditations for all kinds of needs.",3.0,4.28.1,Why do I have to pay for it,333
This app has a $99.95 membership fee. If i had known that i would have never downloaded.,1.0,4.28.1,NOT A FREE APP,88
Great stuff but too pricey for my income please discontinue this subscription as of now.  Thank you for the trial .period...,4.0,4.28.1,"Please discontinue subscription. Jan 29,2019",124
"I wished you could string the session together with auto play. I like to listen to 3 or 4 sessions when I‚Äôm meditating or even when I‚Äôm on a walk. It tends to break my mental focus when I have to reach for my phone every time to find my new session and tap play. It may not seem like it‚Äôs a big thing, but it takes me a generous amount if time to clear my head and focus on my headspace.",5.0,4.28.1,Basics needed: String sessions and loop sessions,387

"you cannot use it unless you pay the premium. in the meantime, it collects your personal information but doesn't tell you until after you're done inputting everything.",1.0,4.28.1,collects personal information then asks for $$,167
"I really wanted to like this app.  I‚Äôm tired of setting up a user name and password for everything!! I deleted it off my phone but the App Store thinks I still have it. Not something that eases my anxiety. I‚Äôm unusual in that I value my privacy so highly. So support, what‚Äôs the best way to get you to forget me?",1.0,4.28.1,Not for me,312
This app is a lovely break in the rat race of life in the 21st centuries life wheel.,5.0,4.28.1,Rat race,84
"I did not like the app, I have deleted the app. There is no contact features for the support team in the app. Hopefully I won't be charged after the first week.",1.0,4.28.1,Refund,160
"I have been having much difficulty sleeping through the night. The first couple of nights  I tried the app I still woke around 3 AM 
Last night I continued to play the meditation and slept through the night! 
My worries didn‚Äôt change, the difficulties didn‚Äôt change but what changed is that I was able to sleep through it this time and that‚Äôs monumental for me . 
When I have difficulties it effects  my sleep the most and maybe with this app I can help myself now.",5.0,4.28.1,Sleep,465
"I answered all the questions to get started then I went to listen to a meditation to try it out and see if I liked it and I have to sign up for premium. I don‚Äôt even know if I like it, you would think they would list stuff for non premium members to watch. Didn‚Äôt really make much sense. I was really looking forward to trying this and possibly buying the app.",1.0,4.28.1,All the meditations you have to pay for you don‚Äôt even get to try anything,360
I just started to this app and I'm young and I have a hard time clearing my mind and I just started to take 3 classes that get me and this is something I need in my life and I'm happy I'm using this app thanks for the support and help ‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèª,5.0,4.28.1,How This App is Great,239
"You will learn valuable lessons and how to sleep better. As an insomniac since 8th grade, this app allowed me to train myself to sleep through the instructors who talk you into deep sleep. Thx",5.0,4.28.1,Peace,192
Cory Muscara has the approach and really delivers,5.0,4.28.1,Feel at peace,49
"I love love love this app! It brings a peace to my day I didn‚Äôt even know I had. With the stress of our lives today it‚Äôs something I look forward to every single day! You can meditate anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes, and there are so many sessions to choose from! Meditation is such a needed exercise in today‚Äôs society, and Simple Habit gives you a personalized way to do it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND for ANYONE!! This app is worth your time! 

Just to note, some sessions are blocked because you need to buy the Premium package. I was a little sad to hear this, as some of the sessions I want to listen to are unavailable without Premium. However, there are so many other sessions available, it‚Äôs a minor setback!",4.0,4.28.1,Amazing!,705
It‚Äôs a great app and it‚Äôs super useful and helps me fall asleep and calm down. I use it almost everyday but I‚Äôm sorta running out of meditations I would like so I‚Äôm think of buying premium. About the 4 star it‚Äôs because so much of the meditations are payed for and it‚Äôs pretty expensive! I would love to buy this but I don‚Äôt earn enough money to and it‚Äôs a lot of money. Hopefully in the future I can buy it though $100 for a year is expensive but I know it‚Äôs a free app and you have to make money somehow. Anyway great app and I love it!,5.0,4.28.1,Amazing App But...,538
I have been using Simple Habit for over a year. I like it and it really helps me to relax in general and with some issues specifically. The app is supposed to keep track of what series you are on. I have started many series. So my account listing what series I am on so I can continue is all cluttered up. I‚Äôd like to be able to cancel a series listed in my account.   So then I can be able to focus on what I am doing now.,2.0,4.28.1,Confusing,423
"I‚Äôve been using Simple Habit for a year plus. I‚Äôm on a 427 day meditation streak and feeling good.
I love the variety of topics. There is a meditation for tons of human needs. I sleep amazing. I look forward to my nightly (and daily) meditations to help me cope, focus, relax, sleep, unwind...whatever I need. 
Try it, you‚Äôll love it!!",5.0,4.28.1,Best meditation app,335
It is great if u want to start meditation but don‚Äôt have time or just can‚Äôt find something for you. I recommend this app 100%.,5.0,4.28.1,Awesome app,126
"there‚Äôs so much free content!!! the meditations aren‚Äôt too fast or slow, i absolutely love them! i‚Äôve used many other meditation apps & i like simple habit the best. i used to have trouble sleeping, but the guided meditations put me right to sleep, especially the one about reviewing your day. i can not recommend this app enough.",5.0,4.28.1,the best so far!,330
"Most helpful app for anyone struggling with insomnia, anxiety, depression, or just wanting to start meditating. 110% recommend.",5.0,4.28.1,Absolutely Brilliant,127
Maybe for beginners but for advanced I found way to much talking and promotion just get to the reason we are here already. Sorry for bad review but get to point faster,2.0,4.28.1,Talk to much,167
This is a really nice way to be guided into a daily centering of oneself. I recommend in the morning!,5.0,4.28.1,Review,101
